5501	I shall have my vengeance, and these fools who dare desecrate my realm shall be the first to die!
5502	Learn new skills if you truly want to upgrade your power.
5503	Those peasants are nothing more than cattle to be converted into Specters and resources.
5504	So the humans picked up arms and formed militias? Doesn't matter, we'll kill them all and harvest every single soul.
5505	Every new skill unlocked makes you stronger.
5506	Yes, you shall all die by my sword then serve me in undeath!
5507	You came for glory and honor, but you shall only be given painful death!
5508	Get more powerful by summoning Specters or making more troops!
5509	The higher level your Corpse Pit, the more powerful the Zombies you may summon.
5510	What makes good Zombies? Good teeth and a powerful jaws.
5511	These arcane items allow us to really speed things up.
5512	Tell Uther to at least send men that knows how to hold a sword.
5513	4,500 is an auspicious number, we'll start by getting 4,500 troops then.
5514	To make your Specters more powerful you'll have to invest in skills.
5515	Not enough Specters? Just slaughter some mobs to summon some more!
5516	The higher level your Drill Grounds, the more troops you could send.
5517	If you develop your skills enough, you may even summon higher level Specters.
5518	Archers? We'll rush them then.
5519	Now lets kill some mobs to summon and try out the all new, higher level Specters!
5520	Keep developing your skills to make those Specters more powerful!
5521	Uther wants to drown us in troops? Ha! We'll see who can muster more troops then!
5522	Archers again? When will the humans learn...
5523	The skeletons will need tougher bones to draw these bows... Upgrade the Shooting Range! 
5524	Our Skeleton Archers don't fear arrows! It's time to turn the tide and turn those human Archers into pin cushions!
5525	An item unused is an item wasted!
5526	We'll need to be able to command more troops at the same time.
5527	More HP or DEF for the Specters? You choice.
5528	It never hurts to have more Specters as cannon fodder.
5529	Eradicate them with our Skeleton Archers!
5530	The enemies would tremble when they see the size of our army!
5531	We could only control so many Specters, so lets make sure they're high level ones.
5532	I think I heard Braaaaains. So the new, higher level Zombies could speak? Lets summon a few and see...
5533	Time to send the Skeleton Archers to deal with their human counterpart again...
5534	Truth be told, some cities are simply meant to be sacked for their resources.
5535	Specters! More Specters!
5536	We'll need more troops if we want to compete against other undead lords!
5537	Now I could finally have a place to read and research some tech...
5538	So this tech teaches you how to send out more than one army of troops at the same time...
5539	Crush them!
5540	So have you decided how you want to further upgrade the Specters?
5541	Forward! Take no prisoners!
5542	Specters, Specters everywhere...
5543	Watching those human Archers run and hide from our rain of arrows is hilarious!
5544	With item, comes speed. With speed, comes victory.
5545	Did I just see that Zombie show off his abs...?
5546	We shall keep expanding our army.
5547	I think I am starting to develop a fetish from killing those puny Archers.
5548	Upgrade the Forlorn Palace! The Undead Knights deserve the best!
5549	Excellent! The Undead Knights have pledged fealty to us!
5550	The war has escalated, we'll need an Alliance if we want to fight on.
5551	Hunt some Void Terror to display the might of your Alliance!
5552	The strength of the Undead Knights is unmatched.
5553	You need more troops to prove your position in the Alliances.
5554	Finally some proper fighting men from the kingdom.
5555	With these items we'll be able to quickly replenish troops.
5556	Their armor is no match for the might of our troops!
5557	I heard that the Warlock King likes the number 30,000...
5558	Upgrade the Drill Grounds again so that we could field more armies of troops in the field!
5559	Imagine the scene when Phalanx troops run from our Undead Knights... hahahaha!
5560	Look at those Phalanx troops falling and crashing like dominos!
5561	More troops? Of course!
5562	The Zombies are complaining that they need a better Corpse Pit, upgrade it!
5563	Wow, looks like that Corpse Pit upgrade made them really more powerful.
5564	Just use items! I want those troops now!
5565	We need more firepower, go summon some Skeleton Archers!
5566	Yes, more firepower! NOW! How? Items!
5567	Get me more Undead Knights! I don't want to see any enemy survivors running away again!
5568	Speed is essential.
5569	With so many troops we'll want to send more of them out at the same time. Upgrade the Drill Grounds!
5570	We'll turn the Phalanx troops into scraps!
5571	It's hunting season again! Assemble with your Alliance members and kill some Void Terrors!
5572	Look at all these troops we have!
5573	With such a powerful army, it would be a waste to not unleash it onto other undead lords...
5574	I came, I saw, I conquered.
5575	Surrender and die!
5576	We'll respawn those corpses in the Burial Site so they can have the honor to fight for us again. Make sure we have enough room though!
5577	Mobs? Just kill them.
5578	Void Terrors? Just kill them too.
5579	Look at all these troops we have!
5580	We need entertainment for our troops, lets send them to kill some mobs!
5581	Other undead lords? Of course we kill them too!
5582	All those cities are just resources waiting to be looted.

6700	Glaurung Day
6701	Strongest Alliance
6702	Glaurung's Fury
6703	Strongest Alliance
6704	<size=30><color=#173B61FF>Event Info</color></size>\nThere are many kinds of creatures in this world. Some are cute, some are smart, some are powerful, and some are terrifying. Glaurung are the latter. With claws that could cut steel like butter and scales of iron that could deflect cannonballs, they are a creature not to be trifled with. Long a creature of legend, the Glaurung have made themselves feared since their mysterious return to this world. Their shrill cry is known to split the sky and send legions of soldiers retreating for shelter. Only the bravest explorers dare approach their Roosts, and at their own peril...
6705	Countless Glaurung have appeared in these lands in recent years. This is a make or break moment for us - we can either cower in fear and let them reign, or hunt them down for their crystals and treasure!
6706	Game of Undeath
6707	The Warlock King has announced the Game of Undeath! Participate in the different phases, complete the objectives, and rewards will be yours! If you manage to place yourself in the overall rankings top 100, you'll get even more!
6708	Compete with other players and win tons of rewards!
6709	Holy Praise
6710	Humans are revolting, attacking the strongest among us!
6711	Reports from the frontline! We found a massive stash of resources in a human Stronghold, but the Stronghold is under protection! Their gods have long passed, and their holy defense is slowly decaying... but too slowly! Let us expand our city closer to their borders to attract their attention. If they send troops to our way and we manage to defeat it, their protection will become weaker! This is a golden opportunity. We can't afford to miss it!

8001	After passing into the afterlife, human corpses exposed to the strong stench of death in the Corpse Pit will slowly transform in Zombies. Although their movements are sluggish and uncoordinated, their rigid and solid bodies serve as strong protection, able to take hit after hit.
8002	Summoned from the depths of the Forlorn Palace, proud and powerful Undead Knights are an enemy's worst nightmare. As these departed souls charge forward on undead horseback, even Mother Earth herself trembles in fear.
8003	Out from the Crypt flies the Lord of the Skies, the Gargoyle. Striking terror from above with a vicious bite and claws that rip flesh into shreds, Gargoyles attack without mercy. The innocent, the guilty, the young, and the old... hope is nonexistent for those who stare into this monster's beady red eyes.
8004	Resurrected from the Cemetery, Undead Mages are the most noble of the Undead army. Equipped with the knowledge to release terrifyingly powerful spells on the battlefield, a Mage's only weakness is the relative squishiness of their body.
8005	Trained in the Shooting Range of the afterlife, Skeleton Archers are known for their precision and cold, penetrating stare. With inexhaustible ammo for their bows (where are all these arrows coming from?), the best way to best a Skeleton Archer is simply to run fast and far away in the opposite direction.
8006	By utilizing the greatest, most evil dark summoning magic, souls are harvested from corpses and transformed into Specters. While terrifying and powerful, these demonesses are extremely fragile. Upon revival, these Specters enter into a pact with the underworld; only a certain number of Specters may be controlled at once, and they may not be resummoned after they fall in battle.

12010	I shall grant you some troops to defend your city. Now sally forth to expand your realm!
12012	My lord, we've found a way to enter the Void by chance while activating the Vortex Fissure. We can now expand our realm into the Void!
12013	Each Void Sector consists of several zones, once you capture all of them, the sector will be yours.
12014	This is the income of the Void Sector. The more Void Zones you control, the higher it gets.
12015	Once you control all zones in this sector, you'll be able to levy Void Energy from the sector!
12016	To expand our realm into the void we'll first need to send some troops there from the city.
12017	Here you can see how many troops you've in the city.
12018	Here you can see the number of troops that you can send each time. You'll also have to wait for cooldown before sending another batch of troops.
12019	Here you can see the Void Energy cost for sending the troops.
12020	These are your troops in the Void, they could be sent back to the city anytime with no cost.
12021	Now let us begin our conquest of the Void, my lord!
12022	Here you can see who's holding the Void Sector now. Tap refresh to switch to a parallel sector.
12038	My lord! Some of our guards captured some goblins sneaking around the city!  Goblins have a nose for treasure, maybe we can use this to our advantage...
12039	Greetings, hu-uh, my lord! I am the chief of a goblin tribe that has long been searching for dragon treasure.
12040	We found a place of...interest near your castle. Let us go, and we'll share the loot with you!
12041	Lowly goblin chief! We are choosing to trust you -- for now. You'd better be true to your word.
12042	We've unearthed a vast collection of eldritch tomes in the College, research them and get some permanent buffs! Upgrading it will unlock new tomes.
12043	The tomes come in different categories and give corresponding bonuses: Military, Defenses, Development, and Resources.
12044	We've finally rebuilt the Altar! You may pray there to get tons of resources! Upgrading it will increase the number of times you could pray for free per day.
12045	Each type of resources has their own Gem cost, and if you're lucky you might even get multiples of what you've prayed for!
12046	The Drill Grounds collects the negative emotions of those slain in battle to empower your armies! Upgrading it will increase campaign troop size limit.
12047	This is where we keep our Non-Bound Wood, Balens, Iron, and Quicksilver from being looted when enemy attacks. It also prevents troops from spending them. Upgrading it will increase the amount of resources protected.
12048	Troops that get taken down defending the city against a siege will be thrown to the Burial Site as long as there is space, and they might be respawned to fight for you again! Upgrade it to expand its capacity.
12049	Respawning them takes time and resources. You may use Gems if you need them immediately though.
12050	Great Hall allows you to join an Alliance. Upgrading increases the number of troops you can have while assembling for a coordinated strike or can have as reinforcements, and also the number of times that you can ask help for.
12051	The Dark Sky helps prevent the enemy from scouting you. Upgrading it will make it more effective against higher level Psychic Eyes.
12052	You may even use its Anti-Scout ability if you really don't want someone peeping at you!
12053	Here you can see how many troops the enemy has.
12054	These are the potential rewards that you might get when you defeat this enemy.
12055	Here you can see all your troops in the city. You may move the slider to change how many troops you send out.
12056	Here you can see how many army of troops can you send out at the same time.
12057	Warlock King's Barriers are extremely powerful buffs. Complete enough of his missions and you'll be able to enjoy them!
12058	Here you can see the current mission from the Warlock King.
12059	Here you can see what will you get when you upgrade the skill.
12060	To summon Specters you'll have to kill mobs like Peasants, Militias, and Archers. The number of Specters summoned and their level is based on what skills you've unlocked.
12061	Congrats! You upgraded your Castle to Lv. 5 and unlocked the Vortex Fissure. You will earn special rewards each time you activate it! 
12062	The Workshop is staffed by the best fallen dwarf smiths. You can craft equipment here. Any materials and equipment you get will also be found in the storage box here.
12063	You need Sanguinium to craft equipment, which you could get by praying at the Altar.
12064	There are two equipment sets - the Conqueror set which is good for warfare, and the Guardian set which is good for developing your city.
12065	Higher level equipment are more powerful but costs more material to make.
12066	You can't mix equipment for different slots, now lets forge a sword!
12067	This is what you'll be forging.
12068	These are the materials needed. You'll also need lower level equipment to craft higher level ones.
12069	Here you can see the possible quality of the equipment. It is affected by the materials' quality.
12070	Here you can see how much Sanguinium is needed, how much you have, and how long it takes.
12071	Now that we've got all the materials, lets tap on the [Forge] button and forge our first piece of equipment!
12072	This is the Hall of the Hunt. You can decide what material you need here, and your minions will hunt for it.
12073	Here are slots to issue bounties. Opening new slots will require some resources.
12074	These are the materials that you could issue an bounty for. Tap on them to see their name and how long you'll need to wait to get them.
12075	To get a material, you'll need to drag and drop it onto a bounty slot. If there are multiple bounties, they would be handled one by one.
12076	We excavated these from the Dragon Tomb...
12077	The Goblins are still digging!
12078	Treasures from across the eons are buried along with the Dragons in the Dragon Tomb. The deeper you go, the better the treasures.
12079	Lets go and explore the Dragon Tomb!
12080	I could smell the treasures, but Tomb Guards are in the way... Eliminate them!
12081	Kill the Tomb Guards to get the treasures that they're guarding.
12082	My lord, we've found a way to enter the Void by chance while activating the Vortex Fissure. We can now expand our realm into the Void!
12083	These are the Void Sectors that we've found so far, they provide different resources. As we upgrade our Castle, more Void Sectors will be discovered. To get to these sectors, we'll need to spend Void Energy.
12084	Each Void Sector consists of several zones, once you capture all of them, the sector will be yours.
12085	Other undead lords will be after the Void also, tap refresh to repel them!
12086	This is the income of the Void Sector. The more Void Zones you control, the higher it gets.
12087	This is where the income is collected. Up to 24 hours' worth of resources can be stored before you collect them.
12088	This shows how much Void Energy you have. It will gradually regenerate if you control a whole Void Sector.
12089	To fight in the Void you'll need troops. All troops except Specters can be sent there using Void Energy.
12090	Here you can see the Void Energy cost and the number of troops that you can send. You'll also have to wait for cooldown before sending another batch of troops.
12091	These are your troops in the Void, they could be sent back to the city anytime with no cost.
12092	Now let us begin our conquest of the Void, my lord!
12093	Dear Lord,\n Come like and share our Facebook fan page! Exciting events and rewards are waiting for you!
12094	1. Once you've built the Alliance Fort, surrounding land will established as your Alliance's Territory. \n2. You may only build Alliance Buildings and enjoy their bonuses within. \n3. The Alliance Fort must be completed for the bonuses to take effect. \n4. Interlapping Alliance Territories become Contested Zone, and you can't build Alliance Buildings there. \n5. Troops collecting resources in Alliance resource points can't be attacked. \n6. When fighting over an Alliance Fort, troops of the Alliance that built the fort can all be respawned when slain, while troops of other Alliances will all be destroyed. This applies no matter attacking or defending but not to Specters. \n7. When fighting over a Rotspitter, the same applies if the battle is in home territory; outside of home territory, both side lose troops as normal.
